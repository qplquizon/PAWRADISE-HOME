# TODO: Fix Filter Issues in Our Animals Page

## Approved Plan Steps
- [ ] Update our-animals.php to change default pet type from 'dog' to 'other' for proper categorization in "all" filter.
- [ ] Ensure pets array uniqueness by reindexing with 'id' as key to prevent replication of pets.
- [ ] Change Bootstrap grid classes from `col-lg-3` to `col-lg-4` for 3 pets per row horizontally when dog filter is active.
- [ ] Test the page to verify filters work correctly (all shows all types, dog shows 3 per row, no duplicates).
