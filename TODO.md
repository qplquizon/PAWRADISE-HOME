# TODO List for Login Check on Donation and Adoption Forms

- [x] Add login check to donate.php: If not logged in, show "You're not logged in" message with link to login instead of the donation form.
- [x] Add login check to adopt.php: If not logged in, show "You're not logged in" message with link to login instead of the adoption form.
- [x] Prevent form submission if not logged in: Add server-side checks in POST handlers for donate.php and adopt.php.
